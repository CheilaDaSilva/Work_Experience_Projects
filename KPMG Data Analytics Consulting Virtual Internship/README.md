## The Client: Sprocket Central Pty Ltd
Sprocket Central is a medium-size company/organisation that sells bicycles and accessories. The client is looking to expand into a new market and needs help with its customer and transaction data. 

## Datasets
The client has a large dataset relating to its customers but their team is unsure how to effectively analyse it to help optimise its marketing strategy.
‚Äúthe importance of optimising the quality of customer datasets cannot be underestimated. The better the quality of the dataset, the better chance you will be able to use it to drive company growth.‚Äù

Client provided KPMG with 3 datasets: 
- Customer Demographic; 
- Customer Addresses; 
- Transactions data in the past 3 months.

## Project Goal
We need to use our data analytics skills to recommend a suitable marketing strategy and find who the marketing team should be targeting out of the new 1000 customer list as well as the broader market segment to reach out to.
To achieve this I performed an RFM analysis to segment the customers and find the high value customers.
